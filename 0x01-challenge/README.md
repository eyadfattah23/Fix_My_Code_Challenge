Sure, let me simplify it for you.

In Flask, when you create a Blueprint, you can give it a prefix. This prefix is like a common starting point for all routes inside that Blueprint. For example, if you set a prefix of `/api/v1`, then all the routes inside the Blueprint will start with `/api/v1`.

Now, when you define routes inside your view files (like `index.py`), you don't need to repeat the Blueprint's prefix for each route. Flask automatically adds the Blueprint's prefix to each route.

Here's how it works in practice:

1. You set the Blueprint's prefix in `__init__.py` inside the `views` folder:

   ```python
   # __init__.py

   from flask import Blueprint

   app_views = Blueprint("app_views", __name__, url_prefix="/api/v1")

   from api.v1.views.index import *
   ```

   Here, you're saying that all routes in `app_views` should start with `/api/v1`.

2. Then, in your `index.py` file, you don't need to repeat the prefix for each route:

   ```python
   # index.py

   from flask import jsonify
   from api.v1.views import app_views

   @app_views.route('/status', methods=['GET'], strict_slashes=False)
   def status():
       """ Status of the web server
       """
       return jsonify({"status": "OK"})
   ```

   You only need to define the part of the route that comes after the prefix. Flask will automatically combine the Blueprint's prefix (`/api/v1`) with the route you define (`/status`), making the complete route `/api/v1/status`.

So, in summary, the adjusted code is simpler because you only need to define the part of the route that comes after the Blueprint's prefix in your view files. The Blueprint takes care of adding the prefix when combining routes.
